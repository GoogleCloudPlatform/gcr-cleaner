# Deploy GCR Cleaner to Cloudbuild

This document describes how to use GCR Cleaner in GCP [Cloud Build][cloud-build] with [Artifact Registry][artifact-registry]

1. Grant a role `roles/artifactregistry.repoAdmin` to the [Cloud Build service account][cloud-build-service-account] 
   because it need `artifactregistry.repositories.deleteArtifacts` permission.

1. Export your project ID as an environment variable.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID="my-project"
   ```

1. Create a YAML file named cloudbuild.yaml which will always keep three images:

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: asia-docker.pkg.dev/gcr-cleaner/gcr-cleaner/gcr-cleaner-cli:latest
        args:
          - -repo
          - "asia-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-image"
          - -keep
          - "3"
          - -tag-filter-any
          - ".*"
    ```    

1. Manual trigger Cloud Build using [gcloud CLI][cloud-cli] to check it:

   ```sh
   gcloud builds submit \
     --project "${PROJECT_ID}" \
     --config cloudbuild.yaml .
   ```
